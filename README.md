Previously I had a task that required displaying a driver's position on a diagram that represented the major expressways around various citites in Japan. The diagram was a simple image file with lines representing the expressways. The diagram was not a literal representation and was not to scale. As a driver was on any of the expressways the diagram should have an icon representing the driver's postion and it should move across the diagram as the driver is moving. 

This project demonstrates a process for implementing the required functionality. The diagram used is a substitue for the original diagram and shows only a partial view of the expressways.
