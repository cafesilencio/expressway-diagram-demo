A demonstration


| https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8f10b5a-a782-48f9-90c1-aef6d247d167 | Previously I had a task that required displaying a driver's position on a diagram that represented the major expressways around various cities in Japan. The diagram was a simple image file with lines representing the expressways. The diagram was not a literal representation and was not to scale. As a driver was on any of the expressways the diagram should have an icon representing the driver's position and it should move across the diagram as the driver is moving. |
